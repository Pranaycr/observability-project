# 🌐 Observability Project (Node.js + Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Jaeger)

This project demonstrates **Observability in action** using a Node.js demo app with:
- **Prometheus** → Collect metrics  
- **Grafana** → Visualize metrics and logs  
- **Loki + Promtail** → Centralized logging  
- **Jaeger + OpenTelemetry** → Distributed tracing  
- **Netdata** → System monitoring (optional)

## 📌 What is Observability?

Observability means having full visibility into how an application is running by collecting:
- **Metrics** → (CPU, Memory, Request count, Latency)  
- **Logs** → (Application logs, errors)  
- **Traces** → (Distributed request flow across services)  

This project shows how to integrate all 3 pillars into one system using **Docker Compose**.
